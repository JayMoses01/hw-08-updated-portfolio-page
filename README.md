# Updated portfolio website

I created a more "polished" version of my portfolio website. Details:
* The updated website features my first project and two homework assignments.
* The portfolio also includes my contact information, links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and a link to download my resume.
* I utilized the Bulma CSS framework (https://bulma.io/) to give my website a more polished look and feel, with a mobile-first design.
